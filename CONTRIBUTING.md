### Update your fork

Is your fork not up-to-date with the NBA-Search code? Most of the time that isn't a problem. But if you like to "sync back" the changes to your repository, execute the following command:

The first time:
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/skekre98/NBA-Search.git
```

After that your repository will have two remotes. You could update your remote (the fork) in the following way:

```
git fetch upstream
git checkout <your feature branch>
git rebase upstream/master
..fix if needed and
git push -f
```

if `rebase` won't work well, use `git merge master` as alternative.

It's also possible to send a PR in the opposite direction, but that's not preferred as it will pollute the commit log.
